@Component
Marks a class as a generic Spring-managed bean that should be detected during component scanning.
To configure a Spring application means to define the necessary instructions for the Spring
Context (the IoC Container) so that it can successfully build, manage, and wire together all the
required objects (Beans) needed for the application to run.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Service
A specialization of @Component used to denote classes that hold business logic
(a semantic alias for clarity).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Repository
A specialization of @Component used to denote classes that interact with databases
(adds automatic persistence exception translation).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Configuration
Marks a class as the source of Java-based bean definitions and ensures inter-bean dependencies
are managed correctly (proxied singletons).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Bean
Used within a @Configuration class to mark a method whose return value should be registered
as a bean in the container.
Job of @Bean: The job of the @Bean annotation is to tell Spring, "Run this method, and whatever
Java object the method returns, please register that object as a Bean in the Context."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ComponentScan
Instructs Spring to search the current package and its sub-packages for classes marked with
@Component, @Service, etc., and register them as beans.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Autowired
Marks a field, constructor, or setter method, telling Spring to automatically inject the correct
dependent bean into that location.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Primary
Marks one bean as the default choice to be autowired when the container finds multiple beans of
the same type.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Qualifier
Explicitly names exactly which specific bean to use at the point of injection, overriding
any @Primary defaults.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Lazy
This annotation indicates whether a bean is to be lazily initialized.
this can be used on a class which is annotated with @Component or methods with @Bean
That means when we explicitly call the class or the method, then only that bean is initialized
This is lazy Initialization. Default init is eager initialization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Scope
defines how often Spring creates a new instance of a bean (e.g., singleton means one shared
instance, prototype means a new instance every time it's requested).
Scopes applicable only for web aware SpringApplicationContext
-> Request Scope - one object instance per single HTTP request
-> Session Scope - one object instance per single HTTP session
-> Application Scope - one object instance per Web App instance
-> WebSocket Scope - one object instance per WebSocket instance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@PostConstruct
As soon as the dependencies are autowired, spring would call the method which is annotated with
@PostConstruct -> This basically means, do something post the constructor dependencies injection
is done
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@PreDestroy
When you want to do something before the application bean is destroyed / terminated from context
It is used on a method as a callback notification to signal that the instance is in the process
of being removed from the container
-> that method is typically used to release the resources that it has been holding
