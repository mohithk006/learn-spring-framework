Jakarta EE is built on top of the JDK.
The JDK (specifically Java SE) provides the foundational Java language, the JVM, and core
libraries necessary for any Java application to run.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Jakarta EE APIs are external dependencies. You must explicitly include the necessary
Jakarta EE libraries
(e.g., the Servlet API JAR file) in your project's build path (like in a Maven or Gradle file),
and you need an application server (like Tomcat, GlassFish, or WildFly) to provide the runtime
environment for those APIs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To summarize:
A Jakarta EE application is a standard Java application that requires the JDK to compile and run,
but it also requires external libraries and a compatible application server to function as an
enterprise application.
